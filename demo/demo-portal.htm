                Introduction
            </h4>

            <p>This page will help you get started with PagerDuty. You'll be up and running in a jiffy!</p>

            <p>PagerDuty provides a number of ways to programmatically interact with a PagerDuty account.</p>
            <p>Whether you are looking to alter an account's configuration, pipe events from a monitoring tool into PagerDuty, update other systems when actions take place in PagerDuty, or retrieve information about activity on a PagerDuty account, there are APIs that expose this functionality to your code.</p>
            <p>The details of how to interact with any given API are accessible in documentation guides listed in the left column navigation.</p>

                <b>REST API</b>
            </h4>
            <p>The REST API is used for accessing and manipulating data concerning all of the entities on a PagerDuty account. It is designed around RESTful principles and provides a standard suite of CRUD actions for most entities: create, read, update, and delete.</p>
            <p>Using the REST API, you can do things like:</p>
            <ul>    
                <li>add and configure users on a PagerDuty account, including how they're notified by PagerDuty</li>
                <li>set up workflows for responding to incidents</li>
                <li>find out who is on call and when they're being notified</li>
                <li>display a list of open or recent incidents for a team</li>
                <li>manually create an incident without an associated monitoring tool</li>
            </ul>
            <div>Note</div>
            <p>The REST API should not be used to create incidents originating from monitoring systems or other automated tools - for that, use the Events API instead. Read more about the synchronous Incident Creation API.</p>
            <p>Ready to dive in? Read the REST API Overview to get started and consult the API Reference for comprehensive details about each endpoint and to try it out right from the documentation.</p>

            <h4 id="dev_header">
                <b>Events API</b>
            </h4>

            <p>The Events APIs, v2 and v1, are asynchronous APIs for connecting your systems to PagerDuty via various monitoring tools. Through the Events APIs, events — which represent occurrences in the services managed by an account — are sent to PagerDuty to be processed.
            </p>

            <p>If you're looking to leverage PagerDuty's Event Management features to turn data gathered from monitoring tools into actionable incidents, the Events APIs are the gateway to doing so.
            </p>

            <p>The Events API v2 Overview and Events API v1 Overview have the basics on what events are and how to send them to PagerDuty.</p>

            <p>Want to get started using PagerDuty APIs quickly and easily? PagerDuty creates, maintains, and supports some API libraries, as does our user community. This directory includes our official libraries, as well as all third-party libraries known to us which support our current public APIs.</p>

            </h4>

            <p>Q: WHAT ARE THE CHANGES IN REST API V2?</p>

            <p>A: REST API v2 enables developers and non-developers to extend the PagerDuty platform with ease. Additionally, customers will have access to far more comprehensive documentation including reliable client libraries/SDKs, so they can deliver with more agility and performance when building new PagerDuty tools against the REST API.
            </p>

            <p>Q: WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF THE NEWER REST API? WHY SHOULD I SWITCH?</p>

            <p>A: The benefits of migrating over to REST API v2 include improved consistency and ease of development, more endpoints and potential add-ons (both pre-built and custom/edge cases), as well as new and improved supporting documentation, best practices and SDKs.</p>
